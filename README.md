# Quadratic Equation Solver
This C script is intended to solve quadratic sequences by getting the formula for the Nth term.

# Method
* Find the second difference (difference between the differences) in the sequence
* Divide it by two
* Sub it into Xn(squared)
* Subtract these values from the original terms of the sequence
* Solve the values got from the subtraction as a linear sequences
* Add half the second difference squared to this equation

# Example Usage
```console
$ ./a.out 1 3 9 19
1 3 9 19
The second difference is: 4
4 divided by 2 = 2
Thus 2n(squared)
|2n(squared)	    |Sequence	   |Difference	  |
|2		          |1		      |-1		      |
|8		          |3		      |-5		      |
|18		         |9		      |-9		      |
|32		         |19		     |-13		     |
Thus: -1, -5, -9, -13,
Difference: -4
Tn=-4n+3
Tn=2n(squared)-4n+3
